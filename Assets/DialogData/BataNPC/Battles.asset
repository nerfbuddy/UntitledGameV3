  dialogue:
  - How do battles work in this game?
  - This is a turn based game, but after you pick a move you will have to do that
    moves minigame.
  - Depending on how well you do in the minigame you will do more or less damage.
  - If a move is red it is a normal move, if it is blue however, it will take 1 MP
    to perform it.
  - Oh, and if you touch an enemy in the overworld you will start a battle with it.
  - Finally, when you beat certain enemies you may sometimes learn a new move.
  - However Ian got lazy and chose to do that last part later. He is such a bum...
  - Yeah he sure sounds like a bum!
