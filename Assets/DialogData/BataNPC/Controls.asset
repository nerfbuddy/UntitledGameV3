  dialogue:
  - What are the controls?
  - You move around with WASD and Interact with Space in the overworld, but clearly
    you have figured that out.
  - You can open the menu with P and change around your moves.
  - Can you can talk with Space, but I would be very impressed if you didn't know
    that already.
